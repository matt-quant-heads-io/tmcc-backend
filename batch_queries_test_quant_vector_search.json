Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received\nfrom our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, associate compensation, operations, occupancy costs, and income\ntaxes. Cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any point in time is subject to\nmany variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment\nterms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $117 million in the first three months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first three months of\nfiscal 2023, primarily driven by a decrease in net earnings, partially offset by changes in working capital.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $73 million in the first three months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first three months of fiscal\n2023, primarily resulting from lower capital expenditures.\nFiscal Q1 2024 Form 10-Q\n17\n", "id": "", "logo": "", "page_number": 20, "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/354950/000035495024000152/hd-20240428.htm", "title": "Home Depot Inc. 10Q 2024-04-28", "company": "Home Depot Inc.", "importance": 1.0}, {"report_date": "2022-10-30", "text": "028 \n1,063 \nAnti-dilutive securities excluded from diluted weighted average common\nshares\n1 \n\u2014 \n1 \n\u2014 \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(1)    Represents the dilutive impact of stock-based awards.\n8.\nCONTINGENCIES\nWe are involved in litigation arising in the normal course of business.

Cost of revenue and \noperating expenses both included a favorable foreign currency impact of 2%.\nCurrent year gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS were negatively impacted by the Q2 charge, which resulted in decreases \nof $152 million, $1.2 billion, $946 million, and $0.13, respectively. Prior year net income and diluted EPS were positively impacted by the net tax \nbenefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, which resulted in an increase to net income and diluted EPS of $3.3 billion and $0.44, \nrespectively.\n44\n", "id": "", "logo": "", "page_number": 43, "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017023035122/msft-20230630.htm", "title": "Microsoft Corp. 10K 2023-06-30", "company": "Microsoft Corp.", "importance": 1.0}, {"report_date": "2024-06-30", "text": " values are primarily recognized in other income \n(expense), net.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value.

Given the \ncomplexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the IRS, evaluating management's estimates \nrelating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including \ninvolvement of our tax specialists.\n97\n", "id": "", "logo": "", "page_number": 96, "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017023035122/msft-20230630.htm", "title": "Microsoft Corp. 10K 2023-06-30", "company": "Microsoft Corp.", "importance": 1.0}, {"report_date": "2024-06-30", "text": "PART II\nItem 8\n \n\u2022\nWhen assessing the reasonableness of assumptions related to forecasted revenue and expenses, we evaluated whether the assumptions \nused were reasonable considering historical financial information of Activision Blizzard, Inc., and the Company\u2019s forecasted financial \ninformation.\n\u2022\nWith the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rates by:\n-\nTesting the source information underlying the discount rates and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculations.\n-\nDeveloping a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management.\n \n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\n \nSeattle, Washington\nJuly 30, 2024\n \nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1983.\n97\n", "id": "", "logo": "", "page_number": 96, "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017024087843/msft-20240630.htm", "title": "Microsoft Corp. 10K 2024-06-30", "company": "Microsoft Corp.", "importance": 1.0}, {"report_date": "2024-06-30", "text": "scaling our AI infrastructure, offset in part by sales mix shift to Azure.\nOperating expenses increased $4.0 billion or 7% driven by Gaming, with 7 points of growth from the Activision Blizzard acquisition, and \ninvestments in cloud engineering, offset in part by the prior year Q2 charge.\nOperating income increased $20.9 billion or 24% driven by growth across each of our segments.\nPrior year gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS were negatively impacted by the Q2 charge, which resulted in decreases of \n$152 million, $1.2 billion, $946 million, and $0.13, respectively.\n43\n", "id": "", "logo": "", "page_number": 42, "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017024087843/msft-20240630.htm", "title": "Microsoft Corp. 10K 2024-06-30", "company": "Microsoft Corp.", "importance": 1.0}, {"report_date": "2024-06-30", "text": "scaling our AI infrastructure, offset in part by sales mix shift to Azure.\nOperating expenses increased $4.0 billion or 7% driven by Gaming, with 7 points of growth from the Activision Blizzard acquisition, and \ninvestments in cloud engineering, offset in part by the prior year Q2 charge.\nOperating income increased $20.9 billion or 24% driven by growth across each of our segments.\nPrior year gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS were negatively impacted by the Q2 charge, which resulted in decreases of \n$152 million, $1.2 billion, $946 million, and $0.13, respectively.\n43\n", "id": "", "logo": "", "page_number": 42, "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017024087843/msft-20240630.htm", "title": "Microsoft Corp. 10K 2024-06-30", "company": "Microsoft Corp.", "importance": 1.0}, {"report_date": "2024-06-30", "text": "scaling our AI infrastructure, offset in part by sales mix shift to Azure.\nOperating expenses increased $4.0 billion or 7% driven by Gaming, with 7 points of growth from the Activision Blizzard acquisition, and \ninvestments in cloud engineering, offset in part by the prior year Q2 charge.\nOperating income increased $20.9 billion or 24% driven by growth across each of our segments.\nPrior year gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS were negatively impacted by the Q2 charge, which resulted in decreases of \n$152 million, $1.2 billion, $946 million, and $0.13, respectively.\n43\n", "id": "", "logo": "", "page_number": 42, "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017024087843/msft-20240630.htm", "title": "Microsoft Corp. 10K 2024-06-30", "company": "Microsoft Corp.", "importance": 1.0}, {"report_date": "2024-06-30", "text": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates.

Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP                      \nSan Jose, California\nJanuary 26, 2023\nAuditor's Reports\n75\n", "id": "", "logo": "", "page_number": 76, "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50863/000005086323000006/intc-20221231.htm", "title": "Intel Corp. 10K 2022-12-31", "company": "Intel Corp.", "importance": 1.0}, {"report_date": "2022-12-31", "text": "\nOperating Income Summary\nOperating income decreased 60% year over year, and operating margin was 20% in 2022 and 38% in 2021.\n(In Millions)\n$\n6,266 \n2022 Operating Income\n(3,047)\nLower gross margin from notebook revenue\n(2,183)\nHigher notebook and desktop unit cost primarily from increased mix of Intel 7 products\n(1,306)\nLower gross margin from desktop revenue\n(1,284)\nHigher operating expenses driven by increased investments in leadership products\n(969)\nHigher period charges primarily driven by inventory reserves taken in 2022\n(320)\nLower CCG other product gross margin driven by lower demand for our wireless and connectivity products and\nthe continued ramp down from the exit of our 5G smartphone modem business\n(262)\nHigher period charges primarily associated with the ramp of Intel 4\n(162)\nHigher period charges related excess capacity charges\n192 \nLower period charges due to a benefit related to insurance proceeds received for business interruption and\nproperty damage that occurred in 2020\n(97)\nOther\n$\n15,704 \n2021 Operating Income\n(840)\nHigher period charges primarily associated with ramp up of Intel 4 and subsequent ramp down of 14nm\n(675)\nHigher operating expenses driven by increased investment in leadership products\n(290)\nLower gross margin from notebook revenue\n(140)\nHigher period charges driven by less sell-through of reserves on products in 2021 as compared to in 2020,\nand additional reserves taken in 2021\n1,080 \nHigher gross margin from desktop revenue\n660 \nLower unit cost primarily due to cost improvements in 10nm SuperFin\n165 \nLower period charges primarily driven by a decrease in engineering samples\n(56)\nOther\n$\n15,800 \n2020 Operating Income\nMD&A\n23\n", "id": "", "logo": "", "page_number": 24, "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50863/000005086323000006/intc-20221231.htm", "title": "Intel Corp. 10K 2022-12-31", "company": "Intel Corp.", "importance": 1.0}, {"report_date": "2021-12-25", "text": ", net\n$\n63,245 \n$\n56,584 \nOther Accrued Liabilities\nOther accrued liabilities include deferred compensation of $2.8 billion as of December 25, 2021 ($2.5 billion as of December 26, 2020) and collateral received for\nderivatives under credit support annex agreements of $1.0 billion as of December 25, 2021 ($2.0 billion as of December 26, 2020).\nAdvertising\nAdvertising costs, including direct marketing, are expensed as incurred and recorded within MG&A expenses.

The\ncompany\u2019s most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM\u2019s 2021 Annual\nReport to Stockholders, under \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates.\u201d In addition, as discussed in note S, \u201cCommitments &\nContingencies,\u201d in IBM\u2019s 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including\ndecisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment.\nAs a result, actual financial results may differ.\n", "id": "", "logo": "", "page_number": 6, "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51143/000155837022001584/ibm-20211231x10k.htm", "title": "International Business Machines Corp. 10K 2021-12-31", "company": "International Business Machines Corp.", "importance": 1.0}, {"report_date": "2021-12-31", "text": "\nrelated to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to\nclose planned transactions.
